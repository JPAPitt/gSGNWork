=== Structure ===

The main idea is that we have functions that will be common to all implementations of the solvers, in particular things like - the solver itself, the functions to calculate energy,etc.

We wish to keep these unchanged and only give different initial conditions, and parameters when doing multiple different rounds of experiments, as in the paper for solitons with SGN beta values and dam breaks for SWWE beta values. 

Thus we group the common functions and write them to their own files there are the:

FD2C-Solver.f - handling all the numerical solver functions/routines
InitialConditionProblems.f - used to generate the intial conditions
MiscellaneousFunctions.f - other common functions that aid the main experiment program (detect string length, and create times to print intermediate results.)

We then have a program which calls all these common functions in the desired way to generate the solutions to the desired intial conditions with the sought after processing of the results. Since we are running a loop of experiments investigating the effect of dx -> 0, we call this particular program LoopExperiments.f . This is the program that we compile with the appropriate linking and run to generate the results.

So we have a structure like this:

(FD2C-Solver.f,InitialConditionProblems.f,MiscellaneousFunctions.f) ----> LoopExperiments.f

where LoopExperiments.f depends on and needs to be linked to all the programs generated by the files on the left. 

=== Important Files ===

- Makefile

   make file to compile and link all subprograms.

   make fresh - command to remove old compiled files, and recompile all LoopExperiments.


- FD2C-Solver.f
   Program that contains all the subroutines to produce the numerical solutions, this is mainly called through the main solver function which iterates until the solution is evolved to the final time. In this example we want to produce the solution at intermediate times and also measure the total energy at the beginning and end.

- MiscellaneousFunctions.f
   Program that contains some miscellanous routines, in particular to generate an array of equally spaced times (for intermediate result printing) and one to find the true length of strings, so that the user doesnt have to count the charachters in directory names each time it is changed. 

- InitialConditionProblems.f
   Program to generate the discretisation of the space, and the associated initial conditions for this discretisation. These intial conditions will also allow the time to be inputted allowing for these functions to also produce the analytic solution for t>0.

- LoopExperiments.f
   Main program to produce the results. There is one main subroutine, and the main program. The main program provides a loop to change dx and thus investigate the convergence. While the subrotuine allows the experiments to have varying array sizes.
