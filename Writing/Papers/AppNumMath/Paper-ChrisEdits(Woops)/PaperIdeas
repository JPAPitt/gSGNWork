My ideas for the papers are as follows:



Paper 1 - Constant Beta Values
   Equations:
      Reformulation
      Conservation
      Wavespeeds
    Method:
      Small - just FDVM2
      Add comments about limiting on gradients
    Validation:
      Analytic Solutions
      Forced Solutions
    Study:
      Convergence of Beta Values
      Interpretation of Different Regimes using Wave Speeds
      
Paper 2 - Varying Beta Values
   Equations:
      Conservation
   Validation:
      A Couple of Scenarios :
          (varying beta in x,t)
          having beta depend on h,dh/dx
   Studies
      Beta switching:
         - Serre 2 SWWE - wave speed collapse
         - SWWE 2 Serre - Dispersive wave expansion
      Robust Method for Transitioning from Serre 2 SWWE in problem areas
         - low depths
         - large gradients in u,h,G?
